## Wiki Contributing

Everything under the `citadel-wiki/` folder will be automatically rendered into wiki pages, respecting folder paths.

For example, `citadel-wiki/engineering/atmospherics.md` will be rendered as `/citadel-wiki/engineering/atmospherics`.
All links between pages should follow this pattern. Always begin with the root `/citadel-wiki/`.

All static content should be uploaded to the `citadel-wiki-static/` folder, and can be linked to with the root path being `/citadel-wiki-static/`. This preserves olders and filepaths.


> The names of these folders and enpoints is subject to change, and is easily mass editable via scripts.
