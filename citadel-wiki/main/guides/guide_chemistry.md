# Guide to chemistry

This guide will primarily be useful for chemists but may come in handy to any player and especially traitors. See Chemical recipes for detailed instructions on how to make complicated chemicals, and for info about using the dispenser's recipe recording function. If you don't have a chem dispenser, see the Guide to Ghetto Chemistry. 

### Tools of the trade

![#ChemDisp](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/a/a6/Dispenser.png) turns electrical energy into a variety of basic chemicals, through magic science. Guard it with your life. If you run out of power, you can disassemble the dispenser with screwdriver+crowbar and rebuild it by first putting the circuit board back, and then all other things but use a full power cell ![PowerCell](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/d/de/Power_cell.png) instead of the old one. Then screwdriver to finish. Or you can charge the machine with an inducer ![Inducer](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/f/f3/Inducer.png). The machine has a built in pH meter and will tell you the pH as you inject chemicals into your beaker, the accuracy being equal to it's upgrades.

![ChemMast](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/9/95/Chemmaster.gif) The ChemMaster 3000 can magically separate chemicals, <b> but not isomers</b> and has the ability to produce a limitless supply of 50 unit pills, 40 unit patches and 30 unit bottles. It can also scan a reagent to give an analysis on the synthesis, accurate purity and optimal pH of a reagent's reaction.

![Grinder](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/3/39/Blender.png) The Reagent Grinder is identical to the grinder the Chef has. It can be used to extract chemical reagents from things the Shaft Miners, Chef, and Botanists produce (See [[GROUND-REAGENTS]](#GROUND-REAGENTS))

### Reagent containers

![Bottle](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/5/5d/Bottle.png) Bottles are small 30 unit containers made from a hardened mesh of glass and polymers, and thus <b>don't melt from temperature or pH</b>. These are produced by the ChemMaster 3000.

![Beaker](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/8/8c/Beaker.png)![LargeBeak](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/f/fc/Large_Beaker.png) Beakers holds 50/100 units of liquid depending on size, but begins to <b>melt under strong acids or bases.</b> These can be printed from the autolathe.

![PlastBeaker](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/8/83/XL_beaker.png) XL beakers are made of plastic and hold 150 units of liquid. <b> They are immune to pH, but will being to melt when containing liquids over 444K.</b> These can be printed from the autolathe using plastic sheets.

![MetaBeak](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/c/c0/Meta_beaker.png) Meta Beakers holds 200 units of liquid and is <b>immune to pH and will not melt under high temperature</b>. These can be printed from the autolathe when researched.

![CyroBeak](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/5/5e/Cryostasis_beaker.gif) Cryostasis Beakers holds 50 units of liquid.
Chemicals will not mix, react or change temperature while in this beaker. Splashing contained chemicals will not make them react either, as with all other beakers. <b>This beaker is immune to pH and will not melt under high temperature.</b> These can be printed from the autolathe when researched.

![BlueBeak](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/5/5b/Bluespace_beaker.gif) Bluespace beakers are the largest beakers and hold 300 units of liquid. <b> These are weak to strong acids/bases, but have more durability than standard beakers.</b> These can be printed from the autolathe when researched.

![Bottle](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/9/9f/Waterbottle.png)![LargeBottle](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/a/ab/Large_water_bottle.png) Water Bottles Can be made with plastic sheets. Works like a beaker but comes with a cap to prevent spilling. Toggle the cap with alt-click. Holds 50/100 units of liquid depending on side. <b> Weak to strong acids/bases and temperatures over 444K.</b>
