Guide to Cloning
===

Death is inevitable even in the 26th century, but unlike the days of old it isn't necessarily the end. When resuscitation fails, there is another option: **cloning**. Provided someone hasn't signed a DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) order and their ghost is still present (meaning the player hasn't disconnected or found a new life in a [ghost role]()), you'll be able to return them to the realm of the living.

**A message from the gods:** "Those who return from the afterlife are not to take any newfound information with them. You may however recall everything from your past life, up to the point of blacking out/losing consciousness. See [Rule 5.5](https://katlin.dog/citadel-rules/main#rule-5-do-not-metagame).
