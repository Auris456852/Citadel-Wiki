# Guide to Ghetto Chemistry

*Because it's not suspicious at all for an assistant to run around spilling acid all over the central hallway...*

## The Tools:
1. All-In-One Grinder <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JYJP1AD.png" width="20" height="20" />
	* Many different things can be ground into different chemicals. From metal sheets to carp fillets, almost every chemical you might need can be found in some form on the station. 
	* Found in the Holodeck or in maintenance. 

2. ChemMaster 3000 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/G5Lve2v.png" width="20" height="20" />
	* The easiest way to separate chemicals is with this machine. If you want your final concoction to be clean, or can't risk some chemicals reacting prematurely, this is the machine you'll be at. 
	* Don't always immediately destroy chemicals you take out of your mix. You might need them later!
	* Found in the Holodeck.
	
3. Lighter <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xAIEMNc.png" width="20" height="20" />
	* Unless you have access to a chemical heater, you'll need one of these. You could also use a match or anything on fire, but a lighter is the most practical. 
	* Take care if you are trying to create ~~Meth~~ a chemical that requires a precise temperature to react. Lighters and the like are not very precise.
	* Found in ShadyCigs Deluxe vending machine.

4. Containers for your Chemicals [img]
	* These can be beakers *acquired* from medical or just soda cans. 
	* The containers for Robust Harvest and most other fertilizers can be used to substitute a dropper. They can be found in the garden.
