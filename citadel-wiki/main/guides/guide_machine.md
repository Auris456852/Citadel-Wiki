# Machines

### Machine Construction Steps
1. Build a machine frame from your 5 metal sheets.
2. Add wires.
3. Wrench it.
4. Add a circuitboard.
5. Examine the machine frame and it will tell you what items you need now.
6. When all the parts are added, screwdriver the machine frame to finish it.

### Linking Machines
Certain machines need to be linked to other machines or computers in order to work properly. There's different methods for different machines:
- Telecommunications machines, Quantum Pad, Mech Bay Power Port and some others: Using a multitool to download and upload data to link two devices which can sometimes require to open the machine's panel with a screwdriver first.
- R&D machines, Turbine, Cloning Pod, DNA Scanner: Interacting with a console to find nearby machines.
- Teleporter Station: Using wirecutters after opening the panel with a screwdriver.

## Autholathe
Produces commonly used items such as tools, equipment, and construction material.<br />
Can be hacked to unlock more designs.

<b>Part Needed</b><br />
  1x Autolathe Board<br />
  1x Micro manipulator<br />
  3x Matter bins<br />
  
<b>Upgrade effects</b><br />
- <b>Better matter bins:</b> the Autolathe can hold more materials.
- <b>Better manipulator:</b> lowers production costs and production time.

## Ore Silo
Stores sheets of materials and shares them with linked machines. Ore Redemption Machines, Techfabs, Protolathes and Circuit Imprinters can be linked to it by first using a multitool on the ore silo, and then using the same multitool on the machine you wish to link it to. By default, the pre-built Ore Silo is already linked to those machines that exist roundstart. Typically found in the Vault.

Clicking the ore silo opens a menu. This menu can be used to unlink machines, and gives you a list of items/materials that have been printed from linked machines, and the area locations of them. Useful if the ORM gets stolen. You can eject/insert materials directly into the silo. If the silo is destroyed, all inserted materials in its linked system will be ejected from it.

<b>Part Needed</b><br />
  1x Ore Silo (Machine Board)<br />
  
<b>Upgrade effects</b><br />

- <b>Chems:</b> Stores chemicals, in bottles, beakers, pills, patches, syringes and pill bottles. Will not store empty bottles, beakers or pill bottles. Named 'smart chemical storage'.
- <b>Viruses:</b> Can store the same items as smart chemical storage, but the fridge is named 'smart virus storage'.
- <b>Disks:</b> Constructs a disk compartmentalizer (instead of a fridge), able to store disks. Mostly useful for botany.

## Nanite Machinery
## Nanite Chamber
Used for implanting non-synchronised (non-cloud) nanites, as well as modifying options of already implanted nanite swarms. Must be operated by a second person with an adjacent Nanite Chamber Control Console (they link automatically). Click the nanite chamber to open it, click-drag a person to put them into the chamber, and then click the console for a menu. With a subject in the chamber, start by clicking "Implant Nanites". This will implant a nanite swarm in the subject. These nanites will not have any programs yet, so they do nothing except generate nanite volume. To install programs you first need to get a nanite program disk with a program on it from a Nanite Program Hub Nanite program hub.png. You have two optional ways to install the program:

1. Without cloud sync: Put the program disk into the nanite chamber control console and click Install Program From Disk. This will install that single program in the subject inside the scanner. Cloud ID must stay set to "No Cloud" or the program will be overwritten by the cloud.
2. With cloud sync: Instead of putting the disk into the nanite chamber control console, open its menu and use it to set a Cloud ID (such as 1). Put the program disk in another console; the Nanite Cloud Controller Nanite cloud controller.gif. Create a backup cloud with the same cloud ID as you just gave the subject (such as 1). Then click that backup and then "Upload Program From Disk". The program will then be installed in all implanted subjects with the same cloud ID within a minute.

Other options in this machine:
Safety Threshold: See Guide to Nanites.
Lock Chamber: Traps the person inside.
Uninstall (program): Removes an installed program (will only work with no cloud sync).

## Public Nanite Chamber
The public nanite chamber will automatically implant nanites into anyone who enters it, without the need for a second person. The nanites will be synchronised to a cloud and will do nothing unless that cloud has nanite programs installed. Use a multitool Multitool.png on the Public Nanite Chamber circuit board first to choose which backup cloud you want it synced to. If you don't multitool the board it will default to cloud 1. You must install programs on same backup cloud with a Nanite Cloud Controller Nanite cloud controller.gif to get functional nanites. Does not need a Nanite Chamber Control Console.

How to use: Use the connected launchpad control console. Click arrow buttons to choose a target tile from the launchpad's perspective (such as 5N, 5E). Click either "launch" to teleport things from the launchpad to the target destination, or click "pull" to teleport things from the target tile to the launchpad. Has a small delay before teleporting. Some things can't be teleported, such as anchored machines.

## Quantum Pad
Can be linked to another quantum pad to set it as a target: when used, it will transfer everything on top of it to its target pad, after a delay, then goes on cooldown.

To link pads: Open the receiving pad with a screwdriver then use a multitool on it to save it on the buffer. Close it, then go to the sending pad and use the multitool on it without opening it. If you want them linked both ways, repeat the procedure with the opposite pads. You can also save a receiving pad to a Quantum Keycard. Simply use the Quantum Keycard on the receiving pad to save that pad as a custom destination. Then activate another quantum pad with the same keycard and it will activate a teleport to the quantum pad saved to the keycard, instead of to the destination saved to the pad.
