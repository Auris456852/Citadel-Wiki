Organ damage will cause side-effects as they reach thresholds, which will alert the owner when passed. If an organ shows up as "non-functional", that means its failing, and will not work, and will cause some life-threatening ailments depending on which organ it is. There is currently no way to see the exact damage of each organ, but for the most part they function on low-threshold, high-threshold, and failing, which will show up as "mildly damaged", "severely damaged", and "non-functional" lists when you scan someone with a medical scanner. Note that all the listed organs decay over time, which is the most common way they'll get damaged- but [[Surgery#Cybernetic_Organs|synthetic organs]] do not! The best way to avoid any of these side-effects is to replace your fleshy organs for [[Surgery#Cybernetic_Organs|metallic ones]], though these too come with downsides in the form of EMP vulnerability.

## Ways of getting damaged:## 

* Flashes and sharp objects in the eyes (eyes)
* Loud noises (ears)
* Appendicitis (appendix)
* Otherwise, an organ that's not in a living body (thus is on the ground or in a dead body) will decay if not held in a freezer, fridge, morgue unit, or [[Machines#Smartfridge|organ smartfridge]]. Organs will go from perfectly healthy to broken in 15 minutes, except for hearts, which will decay completely in 3 minutes, and brains, which will decay completely in 30 minutes.

## Treatment:## 

* [[Surgery#Coronary_Bypass|A coronary bypass]] can be performed on a heart that's decayed past 60 damage, and restores functionality. Good for getting a heart that's too damaged to defib to work again.
* [[Surgery#Lobectomy|A lobectomy]] will do the same as above but for the lungs, which will scarce occur due to their 15 minute decay timer, but it's still an option. 
* [[Guide_to_chemistry#Oculine|Oculine]] will rapidly fix damaged eyes, clearing any shortsightedness/blindness caused by damage.
* [[Guide_to_chemistry#Inacusiate|Inacusiate]] will immediately fix damaged ears to a perfect state.
* Otherwise, time and health will fix most organs (not the brain!). The healthier you are, the faster this rate goes, with a base rate of around half an hour for an organ to go from max damage to perfectly healthy. Taking vitamins increases your health, and thus increases this rate, so eat smart!

## Side-Effects:## 

* Damaged ears will occasionally flare up with tinnitus, causing very brief deafness, with increasingly frequent bouts until the ears are non-functional, at which point you become deaf.
* Damaged eyes will grow increasingly short-sighted, until finally becoming blind when non-functional.
* Damaged lungs will increase the rate at which you breath by 25%, and will collapse if non-functional, causing rapid suffocation. Life-threatening!
* A non-functional appendix will burst, causing toxin damage until the organ is removed. Life-threatening!
* A damaged heart will increase the rate at which you breath by 25%, and will cease when non-functional, causing immediate heart attack. Life-threatening!
* A damaged stomach will be unable to hold nutriment and food down as easily, causing vomiting depending on the amount of food consumed and the damage of the stomach. A non-functional stomach does not digest any food.

# Organ types
Each organ has 100 max hp, except the brain which has 200.

=== ![Organ](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/f/f7/Brain.png)Brain damage ===

Nasty. Randomly causes [[Guide_to_Traumas|brain traumas]] and other problems. If a brain reaches 0% health, the person dies. To be able to see exact brain health, you need an advanced health analyzer, which [[CMO]] gets one of by default. Getting killed and cloned does not cure brain traumas. 

## Ways of getting damaged:## 

* Imperfect cloning.
* Certain chemicals such as [[Guide_to_chemistry#Mercury|mercury]], [[Guide_to_chemistry#Impedrezene|impedrezene]], or [[Guide_to_chemistry#Fentanyl|fentanyl]]
* Abusing certain [[Guide_to_chemistry#Narcotics|narcotics]].
* [[Chaplain]]'s bible applied to the head.
* [[Blood Cult|Unholy Water]]
* [[Infections#Infection_Listings|Brainrot]]
* Earthsblood from [[Guide_to_hydroponics#Plants|Ambrosia Gaia]].

## Treatment:## 

* [[Guide_to_chemistry#Mannitol|Mannitol]] pills or injections slowly cure brain damage, but does not cure [[Guide_to_Traumas|brain traumas]]. 
* [[Guide_to_chemistry#Neurine|Neurine]] will treat the most ## basic##  brain traumas. These traumas have no prefix on health analyzer. 
* [[Surgery#Brain_Surgery|Brain Surgery]], will also cure ## severe##  traumas. You can identify severe brain traumas by the prefix "severe" on health analyzer. [[Nanites#Healing_Programs|Nanites]] can cure these and lower level traumas. 
* [[Surgery#Lobotomy|Lobotomy]] will cure ## deep-rooted brain traumas## . You can identify deep-rooted brain traumas by the prefix "deep-rooted" on health analyzer. Some [[Virus#Symptoms_Table|viruses]] can cure these and lower level traumas. 
* ## Permanent##  brain traumas are either permanent or curable with magic, which is typically unavailable. Failing a lobotomy can cause these traumas. You can identify permanent brain traumas by the prefix "permanent" on health analyzer. If you get one of these, then assume "this is life now".
