"For Cargonia!" - Cargo Technician Action Figure

**The Cargo Technician** handles deliveries in and out of the station. Although they answer directly to the /Quartermaster/, they can perform many of the same tasks their superior can. It's a fairly straightforward role, making it a good choice for new players who want more of a job or direction than the /greytide/ can provide.

## Moving Freight

One of the key components of a Cargo Technician's job is loading/unloading crates and canisters on/off the cargo shuttle, so ideally you've remembered /how to use your hands/. Although they won't automatically do all of the work for you, most stations you'll be working on will have conveyor belts to expedite the process, as seen below: (picture of your standard cargo bay goes here) Notice how the belt leading into the shuttle is longer than the one leading out - most of the time you'll be exporting goods more than importing them. Using these belts is as simple as pushing the buttons to open the shuttle shutters and pulling the corresponding levers to get them moving. Bear in mind your cargo will come to a halt once it leaves the conveyor belt, meaning you'll have to physically move it yourself to keep the belts from getting backed up. Although there's no real harm in leaving the belts running, it's critical you close the shuttle's shutters before sending it out, lest you depressurize it and make it a much less pleasant place to be for the remainder of the shift.

As for what you'll be loading onto the shuttle? In addition to CentCom's shopping list, they'll pretty much take any spare crates and canisters you have lying around, alongside anything your export scanner deems of value (it's the thing you start with that looks like a gun but isn't).

## Taking Orders - The Supply Console

That's not to say you won't have to import goods every now and then - the kingdom of Cargonia serves the people of the station, not just themselves and CentCom.

You may have noticed that some items are priced higher than your initial budget.

Every shift, CentCom provides the station with a list of bounties...
