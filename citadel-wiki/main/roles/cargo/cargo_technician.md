As a **cargo technician**, you're expected to keep command and your boss, the [Quartermaster](/citadel-wiki/main/roles/cargo/quartermaster), happy by making as many credits as possible. But don't sweat it, there's just as many ways to go about doing it! 
Cargo tech is a fairly straightforward role, making it a good choice for new players who want more of a job or direction than the [greytide](/citadel-wiki/main/roles/civillian/assistant) can provide.

## Cargo Bay
The home of the supply team, Split into 4 sections. A front office where you can order crates and deal with crew members, the main area, where the loading and unload of the shuttle is done, the warehouse where unused crates are stored and the mining area for the miners.

## ![#Space Cash](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/2/27/Cash_1000.png) Credits Keep the Station Orbiting
The easiest way to get some initial cash at the start of a round is to drag the empty crates stored in the warehouse and cargo office and load them onto the shuttle. Collecting crates and items of value is your first and foremost way of generating credits. 
Many items have surprisingly high value, so you should keep the scanner you begin the shift with in order to scan items to see how much central is content on offering for them.

At the beginning of the shift, you can print out bounty sheets from the bounty console normally in the cargo office. Be sure to hand them out to the different departments around the station and make sure they know about them. Bounties make you quite a bit of money, some you can do yourself, while others are more suited for other departments to fulfill. 
Depending on the bounty, some can be found throughout the station, in maintenance or need to be made by certain departments. Once you've acquired a bounty you just need to put it onto the supply shuttle and send it off, it can be on the floor or in a crate/locker and it will count.

## ![#Crate](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/6/65/GrayCrate.png) Order Up
Your primary function on station is ensuring that the station is well supplied, this is done by dealing with orders from crew members and making sure you've got a steady supply of credits. To take an order from a crew member for a crate will usually involve them walking up to your desk, telling you what they want or using the nearby computer to submit a request (preferred). Once you know what they need, you can approve or deny it. If you're unsure if you should order something for someone ask yourself and them a few questions.
* What are they ordering?
* Is it for their department?
* What do they need it for? 
* Does the crate their ordering contain important, dangerous or restricted gear?

Handing out laser rifle crates to the dodgy looking assistant with a gas mask on is a good way to end up unemployed or worse. If in doubt still, you can always ask the Quartermaster or the head of the department the crew member is ordering from. 

Now that you have a ton of credits (hopefully) you can begin using these credits for things people have requested and other useful things. The supply console is where you can select a number of crates to purchase from central command and have delivered by the supply shuttle. Once you have your necessary crates selected for purchase, call the shuttle. You can do whatever with the requisition forms, be it placing them in a marked folder to go in the filing cabinet, leaving them in a giant pile on the floor, dump them into the trash, or burning them. Your crates should arrive after a set amount of time and you will be able to drag them off. 

One of the key components of a Cargo Technician's job is **loading/unloading crates and canisters on/off the cargo shuttle**, so ideally you've remembered how to use your hands. Although they won't automatically do all of the work for you, most stations you'll be working on will have conveyor belts to expedite the process.  
Notice how the belt leading into the shuttle is longer than the one leading out - **most of the time you'll be exporting goods more than importing them**.  
Using these belts is as simple as pushing the buttons to open the shuttle shutters and pulling the corresponding levers to get them moving. Bear in mind your cargo will come to a halt once it leaves the conveyor belt, meaning you'll have to physically move it yourself to keep the belts from getting backed up. Although there's no real harm in leaving the belts running, it's critical you close the shuttle's shutters before sending it out, lest you depressurize it and make it a much less pleasant place to be for the remainder of the shift.

To finalize receiving a crate, you will first need to check the cargo manifest against the contents of the crate. Grab the accept and deny stamps from the cargo office and return to your purchased crates. Rip off the manifest from the attached crate and read it thoroughly, make sure the station name matches and that the amount of items described on the manifest are present in the crate it came from. If you received too many items, place a denied stamp on in and place it in an empty crate. If you received a crate missing items, deny that one as well but make sure you return the entirety of the crate (including the manifest) to the shuttle so central can reimburse you the funds. If everything checks out, stamp it accepted and place the sheet in a crate. You make money on correctly stamped manifests that you send to central, you will LOSE MONEY on incorrectly stamped manifests. Some crates are locked, and will need a certain type of access to unlock, unless you can break into them, just call for whoever can open it.

## ![#MULEbot](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/2/2f/MULE.gif) Express Delivery
There are many ways on delivering the goods you order from central. The first is by hand, dragging the crate (or closet if you elected to keep the crate for that sweet sweet credit) and bring it to where ever it is destined for. While this can be exhausting, you can be sure the recipient received their goods in person. Just be wary of spry assistants who want a look at what you're hauling. Along this line, you can even call for whoever that their crate is in, and have them come pick it up themselves.

Another way is to send it out on a MULEbot. These big bots can carry quite a bit of weight. Load a crate onto one and in it's controls, set its destination and tell it to go. The bot will do the moving for you and return back once finished. MULEbots are slower than you, but only people with access to their controls (or an assistant camping one out to hack it) can stop the bot and steal the package. They will leave their delivery in the department's delivery chute, and you should inform said department when the bot says it's dropped its load off. As again, any one with maintenance access can grab the crate once unattended. Your PDA can see where and what the MULEbots are doing, if one gets stuck, be sure to go save it.

Shipping supplies through disposals is also a good way to send goodies to just about anywhere. Within the mailroom, take the crate/closet with supplies and wrap it closed. Pick up the destination tagger and select the area you wish the crate to show up in. Then, push it into the disposal loop and it's off. Once in the system, it will find it's way to the disposal unit within the destination. This is fast, but if a piece of disposals has been blown up or misdirected, your package can end up unattended in the middle of the hallway.

Last, but definitely not least, once science has researched into bluespace enough, you can construct a supply pod console board from the cargo lathe. These consoles allow instant purchases of crates, so long as you buy a supply beacon for the pods to aim at. After constructing the console, you will need someone with quartermaster access to unlock it. This can be the QM, HoP, or Captain. Supply pods are dangerous, and live animals purchased this way are normally dead on arrival. Crates bought in this way will have their price marked up a bit as well, so consider if you want to use the money for a speedy delivery or to do it the old fashion way instead.

## Unionizing!
Cargo is an integral part to any revolution, for without cargo, the heads have only five or so mindshields to quell the rebellion. Loyalist cargo techs are to listen to the QM/other heads on crates to purchase. Be on the look out for bombs and other nefarious tactics the revs will use to try to shut your department down with.

Revolutionary cargo techs are quite strong, as unlike security, you have a vast amount of guns and equipment at your disposal if you know how to hack open a crate or two. Your biggest threats of course be the heads, loyalists, and security if you're found not buying mindshields. The Quartermaster, if ganged up on early, is normally an easy target to finish off.

## ![#Syndibox](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/b/b7/Syndibox.png) Going Postal
The Cargo Tech gets quite a few advantages as a traitor. Their relative lack of importance and ample job slots means a tech can go missing and do their own thing without too much oversight, when questioned where they've been, a "In maint" answer wont draw much suspicion.

Traitor cargotechs are in the lucky predicament, able to forgo buying traitor weapons through telecrystals by swiping a Cryptographic Sequencer over their supply console and ordering a number of nullcrates. Nullcrates come with a random assortment of syndicate tools. After having yourself to the booty, be sure to hide/destroy unneeded contraband, return emagged crates on the shuttle, and burn the requisition forms.

Be wary of leaving a paper trail of purchase orders and missing credits, which a keen quartermaster paying attention may notice. Crates can also be opened with a stolen ID of the correct type, or damage from a weapon.
