## Cargo Bay
The home of the supply team, Split into 4 sections. A front office where you can order crates and deal with crew members, the main area, where the loading and unload of the shuttle is done, the warehouse where unused crates are stored and the mining area for the miners.

## ![#Crate](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/6/65/GrayCrate.png) Order Up
Your primary function on station is ensuring that the station is well supplied, this is done by dealing with orders from crew members and making sure you've got a steady supply of credits. To take an order from a crew member for a crate will usually involve them walking up to your desk, telling you what they want or using the nearby computer to submit a request (preferred). Once you know what they need, you can approve or deny it. If you're unsure if you should order something for someone ask yourself and them a few questions.
* What are they ordering?
* Is it for their department?
* What do they need it for? 
* Does the crate their ordering contain important, dangerous or restricted gear?

Handing out laser rifle crates to the dodgy looking assistant with a gas mask on is a good way to end up unemployed or worse. If in doubt still, you can always ask the Quartermaster or the head of the department the crew member is ordering from. Once you've taken their order and clicked it on your supply console it'll be added to a list that'll be sent the next time the shuttle is sent from centcomm. You can do this yourself by clicking the button near the top, ensure that no crew members are on the supply shuttle before trying to send it off. Once their crate arrives you can hand it over to them, or let them know its arrived. 

## ![#MULEbot](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/2/2f/MULE.gif) Delivery and Disposals
You can get crates and boxes where they need to go without ever leaving your stoop. You can do this with both the MULE bots and the disposals system. To use the MULEbot, drag a crate over to it, then drag the crate onto it to load it on. Open up your PDA and go to the one of the lower options on the main menu, Delivery Bot Control. From here you can send off your MULEbot to deliver its load at a selected destination.

To use the disposals system you'll need to bring your crate to the smaller disposals room near the cargo office, using the wrapper, wrap your crate, then using the Destination Tagger, set where you want the crate to go. Pull the lever and you can watch it get whisked away and off on its journy through the disposals system.

## ![#Space Cash](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/2/27/Cash_1000.png) Cash Flow
The easiest way to get some initial cash at the start of a round is to drag the empty crates stored in the warehouse and cargo office and load them onto the shuttle. Collecting crates and items of value is your first and foremost way of generating credits. With maintenance access, a cargo tech can crawl maint tunnels to look for precious crates and fuel tanks to bring back for sale. You can check the price of items using your export scanner, which starts in your pocket.

Your other source of funds are bounties, a list of which can be found on the bounty console found in the Cargo Office. Using this same console you can print off the list and then put the paper on the door to cargo to let anyone stopping by check them without having to ask. Another good idea is to print out 6 or 7 and then go put them on the doors to different departments, the chefs table, the bar and any other areas you have bounties for. Depending on the bounty some can be found throughout the station, in maintenance or need to be made by certain departments. Once you've acquired a bounty you just need to put it onto the supply shuttle and send it off, it can be on the floor or in a crate/locker and it will count.

## ![#Syndibox](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/b/b7/Syndibox.png) Going Postal
The Cargo Tech gets quite a few advantages as a traitor. Their relative lack of importance and ample job slots means a tech can go missing and do their own thing without too much oversight, when questioned where they've been, a "In maint" anwser wont draw much suspicion.

With almost immediate access to gear they shouldn't have, an Emag isin't a bad choice, allowing them to open up crates meant for security or engineering. However this can lead a papertrail of a purchase order and the missing credits, which a QM paying attention could notice. The emag can also be used on the ordering console for a wider and more dangerous supply of crates, however anyone other techs or a QM may notice the new unusal selection. Crates can also be opened with a stolen ID of the correct type, or damage from a weapon.
