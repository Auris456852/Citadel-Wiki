The Botanist
===

**The Botanist**, as you can imagine, grows and tends to plants. Although you answer to the /Head of Personnel/ and will likely be working with the /Chef/ and /Bartender/ most of the time, you can grow things for other departments and even the station at large. In a way, their job resembles the very thing they work with - easy to understand at a base level but there's a lot more to it beneath the surface.
