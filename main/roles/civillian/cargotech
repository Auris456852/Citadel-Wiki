"For Cargonia!" - Cargo Technician Action Figure

**The Cargo Technician** handles deliveries in and out of the station. Although they answer directly to the /Quartermaster/, they can perform many of the same tasks their superior can. It's a fairly straightforward role, making it a good choice for new players who want more of a job or direction than the /greytide/ can provide.

## Moving Freight
One of the key components of a Cargo Technician's job is loading and unloading crates and canisters on and off the cargo shuttle.
