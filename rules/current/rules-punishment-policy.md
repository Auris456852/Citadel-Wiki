Punishment Policy
---

## Banning rules:
* Give new players the benefit of the doubt before banning and provide them with a stern warning; do not ban on their first offense, unless they are an obvious griefer.
* Adjust ban times based on severity and the contriteness of the offender.
* For regular players, a permanent ban should never be the first ban.
* Player may be job-banned for one of three things: abuse/powergaming, incompetence, or using their job to grief other players.
* Players should be warned about their behavior before being job banned. Temporary job-bans should be applied first; do not directly permanently ban someone from a job unless you believe their actions were severe enough to warrant a permanent ban.
* Players in a head role are subject to more severe punishment. This includes a "temporary permaban" wherein they will be banned for an indeterminate amount of time, until the admins believe they are competent and/or mature enough to once again take on the role.
* All job-bans and server-bans may be accompanied by the other, depending on severity.
* Department-wide bans should only be applied for the most egregious actions, or if there's a risk of the player circumventing the ban reason by playing in the same department.

## Banning steps:
1. Investigate
  When a situation comes to your attention, investigate first. Check logs, variables, contents, and the environment first. Do this before or while you're completing step two.
2. Question players
  Question whoever you think is relevant; the suspicious party(s), the victim(s) if there are any, any witnesses, other admins, and observers. 
3. Determine guilt
  It's time for you to determine whether a player is guilty of breaking the rules. Remember to compare what you learn with what you have from step one and two. 
4. Check previous notes & bans
  Take into account the player's previous bans and notes. Decide if they should be left with a warning and a note, or if they should be banned.
5. Check the banning scale
  Use the banning scale to help you determine ban length if it's going to be a temporary ban. Remember that the scale is only a guide, not a set rule.
6. Should the ban be permanent?
  Determine whether the ban should be temporary or permanent. Remember not to give permanent bans to first time offenders (if they aren't griefers).

### Banning scale

Use the banning scale to help you determine the length for a server ban. Remember that the scale is just a guide and not the set amounts that should be given for every situation.

Some rules of thumb to remember are:

* If a player seems genuinely contrite, consider reducing their ban.
* If a player is being incredibly rude, attempting to interfere with your investigation, or won't cooperate, you may increase the ban.
* Remember that any player who regularly comes close to breaking a rule (toeing the line) should be counted as breaking that rule. If they have a large number of notes or warnings it may even be worth increasing the ban length.

#### Job bans
Job bans can typically be set in days or weeks instead of hours, depending on severity. If a job-ban is accompanying a server-ban, the job-ban should be double the length of the server ban (or more).

#### Other Bans
* Ban players from OOC only for rulebreaking that relates to OOC. OOC bans can be used in lieu of or conjunction with a server ban.
* Identity bans can be used on players that break rules regarding characters (i.e., they keep playing as pop culture characters). It may also be used to prevent meta-friending and meta-comming.
* Emote bans are for players who use emotes to either circumvent language restrictions or to harass other players.

#### Other punishments
In lieu of banning, you can use other methods to punish players for a single round. Kicking, deleting their character, sending them to admin prison, muting them, forcing their character to sleep are all acceptable punishments for very minor infractions.

## What to do if you're banned:
The first step is to wait and think about what you did. No, really; take a break and do something else so you can mull it over. Even if you're in the right, if you go berzerk and start berating the staff no one will care about your ban and it may even be lengthened. After you think about it and you still think your ban was unfair, ask an admin for the logs from the round you were banned in.

After you've read through the logs, read through the rules that relate to your ban. Did you break any? If not, have you been skirting the rules? Remember that "toeing the line" is still counted as breaking the rules; even if you aren't breaking the rules in a literal sense, you may be breaking the spirit of the rules. If you still don't think your ban was just, continue to the appeal.

Before you make your appeal, think about how long your ban was for. Was it for less than a day? If so, it's not worth appealing; generally a ban appeal will take at least a day to be processed. Now, how long into your ban are you? Have you waited a while? If your ban is more than a couple of days long, you'll want to wait until the next day to post your appeal. If at this point you're ready to go, get to the ban appeal page and create your post using the format provided. If you were a good boy or girl and got your logs, be sure to use them in your defense.
