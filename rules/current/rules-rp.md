## Rule 1: Do not grief
1. End of round grief (AKA, EORG; i.e., griefing at the end of a round in the time after the shuttle has arrived at CentCom) is not allowed on the RP server.

## Rule 3: Stay in character
1. Do no pick disabilites that interfere with your ability to do your job (e.g., a blind chef, mute security officer, or deaf engineer).
2. Characters can not posses ties to either Central Command or the Syndicate in their back stories.

## Rule 5: Do not metagame
1. All antagonists are non-canon, and therefor information regarding them is not retained across rounds. Outside of using the [Identifying Antagonists Guide](https://wiki.vore-station.net/Identifying_Antagonists), you must learn it ICly before acting on the information.
2. Do not abuse the respawn system. Using it to get back at players by switching roles or jobs, or using it as a respawn when your character is clearly taken out of the round and not going to be cloned during the round is not allowed.

## Rule 6: Do not powergame
1. Limit what you know in character. It's reasonable for a character to have skills outside their occupation; it's not reasonable for a character to be well versed in multiple high level or difficult fields. (e.g., being able to set up the reactor and perform surgery)
2. Do not use size gun for a combat advantage. This is specifically referring to shrinking people to be able to kill them faster than the game regularly allows.

## Security policy
1. As security, it is recommended that you follow [Corporate Regulations](https://wiki.vore-station.net/Corporate_Regulations) as closely as you can (especially if you are new). As you gain more experience however, it may be advantageous to deviate from Space Law in certain situations to better police the station. Leniency, cracking down, and your ability to pick and choose what to enforce and what not to enforce are all powerful tools, but should be used carefully; you can and will be held responsible for your decisions.
2. Internal Affairs Agents (IAAs) are situationally powerful on roleplay. Do not mistake your position for being equal to a head of staff or security. You are essentially an in-character moderator who uses [Standard Operating Procedures](https://wiki.vore-station.net/Standard_Operating_Procedure) (SoP) to settle legal disputes or complaints.

## Command policy
1. If you are uncertain about jurisdiction, duties, and et cetera, read over the [Chain of Command](https://wiki.vore-station.net/Chain_of_Command).
2. Only the head of personnel may assume the role of acting captain; except in the event of an emergency situation, the HoS may also assume the role.
3. Do not extend the access of your ID as acting captain except during an emergency.

## Silicon policy
1. The default lawset is not hierarchical, all laws have the same priority.
