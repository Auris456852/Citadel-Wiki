##Basic standerds that you want or have to follow!

The standerd template

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game

<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be worth adding. -->

<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags, changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->


##How to use the the auto tagging system
We have a bot that is _really_ helpful for adding in basic tags, most of the time they will add sprites, sound changes and cofig changes all on its own. 
Some times you want to add in your own tags to show that its a Do Not Merge or a Work In Progress - To add these tags you must at the start of the name of the Poll Request in *brackets* do -
[S]   for fix
[WIP] for Work In Progress 
[DNM] for Do Not Merge 
[READY] to auto tag that the poll request is ready for review.
######[READY] WILL remove Work In Progress - Also note that changing the heading of a Pull request will add tags using brackets 

##The Changlog section
If you make a poll request without changing them they *WILL NOT* auto add the tags to the poll request, and once you hit summit you can not add the tags via Changlogs, so make sure your adding the correct tags as they can not be easily removed.
To remove a most tags you will need a maintainer to take off the tag.

##Why is this good for the game
This is the part of the template were you state why your changing this, and describing the need or want for said changes to be merged.

_Examples_

"Help keep the in line with other objects of similar nature like [x] or [y]. Balancing [this item] so that its not flat out better then [x,y] but still keep it around for more options and variety in the department."

"[Redone/Nerfed item] has little to no counter to it well being cheap/easy to get, by [Redone/Nerf] it should not be the go to item for every problem, well still being useful"

"Corrects grammar" or "Reworks the wording done as to be less misleading / more straightforward"

##About The Pull Request
This is were you tell about what your changing and giving numbers/stats about it. This is almost always monitory for a Pull Request.
Any undocumented changes that are found may lead to a maintainer or fellow coder to question the Pull Requests.
**Having a misleading or wrong About section is poor form and likely will be asked to be corrected and or closed**

_Examples_

"Adds a new item called [Name] to techwebs"

"Rebalances armor from [Armor stat old] to [Armor stat new]"

"Gives [Role/antag] a new [Item/power] called [Name]"

"Fixes runtimes with [X]"

"Unmodular file(s) [X](,[Y])"

##Addtional notes
Adding in spare notes can be useful to help get your point across or better explain to reader why your changing/adding/removing.
It is not monitory to add spare notes, though it can look nicer to have a "To Long Didn't Read" cliff note section for people to glance at.
